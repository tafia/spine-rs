# spine

```toml
[dependencies.spine_tiny]
git = "http://github.com/tomaka/spine-rs"
```

```rust
extern crate spine;
```

Parses a Spine document and calculates what needs to be drawn.

## Step 1: loading the document

Call `skeleton::Skeleton::from_reader` to parse the content of a document.

This function returns an `Err` if the document is not valid JSON or if something is not
 recognized in it.

```rust
let file = File::open(&Path::new("skeleton.json").unwrap();
let skeleton = spine::skeleton::Skeleton::from_reader(file).unwrap();
```

## Step 2: preparing for drawing

You can retrieve the list of animations and skins provided a document:

```rust
let skins = skeleton.get_skins_names();
let animations = skeleton.get_animations_names();
```

You can also get a list of the names of all the sprites that can possibly be drawn by this
 Spine animation.

```rust
let sprites = skeleton.get_attachments_names();
```

Note that the names do not necessarily match file names. They are the same names that you have in
 the Spine editor. It is your job to turn these resource names into file names if necessary.

## Step 3: animating

To run an animation, you first need to call `skeleton.get_animated_skin` to get a `SkinAnimation`.

You then have 2 methods to get the sprites you need to draw:
- directly call `animation.interpolate` for a given time
- use a built-in `AnimationIter` iterator by calling `animation.run()` to run the animation
with a constant period

Both methods returns a `Sprites` iterator over the `Sprite`s do be drawn.

```rust
let animation = skeleton.get_animated_skin("default", Some("walk")).unwrap();

// either use `interpolate`
let sprites = animation.interpolate(0.3).unwrap();
// or use the iterator
let sprites = animation
              .run(0.1)  // iterator that interpolates sprites every 0.1s
              .nth(3);   // get the 3rd item generated when time = 0.3
```

The result contains an iterator over the sprites that need to be drawn with the `skeleton::SRT`
(scale, rotate, translate)). The srt supposes that each sprite would cover the whole viewport
(ie. drawn from `(-1, -1)` to `(1, 1)`).  You can convert it to a premultiplied matrix using
`srt.to_matrix3()` or `srt.to_matrix4` ; if you want to apply your own matrix `C` over
 the one returned `M`, you need to call `C * M`.

```rust
for sprite in animation.interpolate(0.3).unwrap() {
    let texture = textures_list.get(&&*sprite.attachment).unwrap();
    draw(texture, &sprite.srt, &sprite.color);
}
```
